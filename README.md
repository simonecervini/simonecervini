I'm a full-stack engineer building stuff for the web.

- Founder of [VagabondBase](https://vagabondbase.com)
- Maintainer of [Liqua](https://github.com/simonecervini/liquachat)
- Co-founder of [Compoundeer](https://compoundeer.com)
- Portfolio of other projects coming (very) soon.

**Looking for my next challenge**: if you’re building something ambitious and need an engineer who thinks like a product owner, [let’s talk](mailto:simone@simonecervini.dev)!
